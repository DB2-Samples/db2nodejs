# DB2 NodeJS Mock Webstore Sample - Requires Db2 Version 11.1.2.2

db2-node-demo is a simple implementation of an app running on Node.js runtime
demonstrating how to connect Node.js applications to Db2. It includes examples of
running both regular SQL statements as well as those containing JSON. The example
also includes supporting dozens or hundreds of users through a set of three 
connection pools to Db2.

## Installing NodeJS

If you have not already, download node.js and install it on your local machine.
Use the latest LTS build from the https://nodejs.org/en/download/ website.

## Installing up the app

1. Clone the app to your local environment from your terminal using the following
 command:

  ```
    git clone https://github.com:LarryKX/db2nodejs.git
  ```

2. `cd` into this newly created directory

3. Install the required npm and bower packages using the following command

  ```
  npm install
  ```

## Setting up the database

1. `webstore.ddl` contains SQL to set up the tables required to simulate the mock
webstore. You can either:
  
    a. Create a database called `WEBSTORE`, or
  
    b. Change `CONNECT TO WEBSTORE` near the top of this file to connect to a
    different database you wish to use
    
2. Run the SQL to create the tables. Run ```db2 -tvf webstore.ddl``` from the Db2
 command line. You can also run the script using Data Server Manager. If you use DSM,
  make sure the SQL Editor Run Method (Edit SQL Options) is set to CLP with SSH.


## Setting up the app

Start your app locally with the following command
  ```
  npm run test
  ```
The app will be launched at http://localhost:8888/
